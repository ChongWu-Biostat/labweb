## Welcome to the Chong Wu Research Group

We are a research group led by **Chong Wu** in the **Department of Biostatistics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center**. Our mission is to develop and utilize cutting-edge statistical methodologies and computational algorithms to analyze complex genetic and genomic data. **Our Research Focus:**

1. **Method Development:** We create novel approaches tailored for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), DNA methylation, gene expression, and **proteomic** data analysis. Our expertise spans statistical genetics, causal inference, statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning.
2. **Understanding Disease Etiology:** A key goal is identifying putative causal biomarkers (genes, CpG sites, proteins) to unravel the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases like pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.
3. **Advancing Precision Medicine:** We aim to enhance risk prediction models by integrating multi-omics data, ultimately contributing to more personalized healthcare strategies.
4. **AI for Science:** We are actively exploring the frontiers of **Artificial Intelligence in scientific discovery**. This includes developing and applying **DNA foundation models** for downstream tasks like gene expression prediction, leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to predict cancer treatment outcomes, and utilizing AI approaches for **drug discovery**.
5. **Commitment to Reproducibility:** We strongly believe in reproducible research and open science. We develop and maintain several software tools (primarily R packages) and their documentation to facilitate the use of our methods by the wider research community. Feel free to browse our [research findings](/publications/) and check out our [software resources](/software/). <!-- **** UPDATE these links if your page permalinks are different **** -->
