Our research focuses on developing and applying novel statistical and computational methodologies to tackle complex challenges in genetics, genomics, and biomedical science. We leverage causal inference, machine learning, integrative multi-omics analysis, and AI to gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms, identify biomarkers, improve risk prediction, and enhance drug discovery.

        <p>
        We develop novel methods for causal inference from observational data. A major focus is <strong>Mendelian Randomization (MR)</strong>, using genetic variants as instrumental variables to probe causal effects while minimizing confounding. We have developed novel techniques to address key MR challenges like the winner's curse bias arising from IV selection (RIVW; Ma et al., <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-51/issue-1/Breaking-the-winners-curse-in-Mendelian-randomization--Rerandomized-inverse/10.1214/22-AOS2247.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Annals of Statistics</i> 2023</a>) and widespread pleiotropy (CARE; Xie et al., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>arXiv</i> 2023</a>). Beyond MR, our work includes efficient estimation of <strong>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</strong> using iterative Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (iTMLE; Wei et al., <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/79/3/1934/7513856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Biometrics</i> 2023</a>) and robust, nonparametric <strong>Propensity Score Estimation</strong> through deep learning that directly optimize covariate balance (Peng et al., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>arXiv</i> 2024</a>).

        Our group pioneers statistical methods for integrating diverse high-dimensional data (GWAS, eQTL, epigenomics, proteomics) to elucidate disease mechanisms. We develop computationally efficient approaches for multi-omics integration, including advanced imputation techniques (SUMMIT; Zhang et al., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34016-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Nature Communications</i> 2022</a>), incorporating regulatory elements like enhancers and mQTLs (Wu & Pan, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/209/3/699/5930933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Genetics</i> 2018</a>; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/19/3576/5429240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Bioinformatics</i> 2019</a>), and powerful fine-mapping strategies (FOGS; Wu & Pan, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-019-02098-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Human Genetics</i> 2020</a>). These methods aim to identify novel disease-associated genes and pathways from genetics and genomics data.

We develop methods to integrate multi-omics data and genetically predicted biomarkers with PRS (Wu et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cac2.12205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Cancer Communications</i> 2021</a>) and evaluate strategies to improve the accuracy and clinical utility of PRS for complex diseases like coronary artery disease, comparing performance against standard clinical risk models (King et al., <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02583-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>BMC Medicine</i> 2022</a>).

        <p>
        A cornerstone of our research is the commitment to open science and reproducibility. We actively develop and maintain robust, validated, open-source software implementing our novel methods, primarily as R packages (e.g., MiSPU, GLMaSPU, prclust, FOGS, CMO). We prioritize user-friendliness, providing comprehensive documentation and tutorials to make complex statistical tools accessible. An example is the <a href="https://www.gcbhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Global Causal Biomarker Hub (GCB Hub)</strong></a>, a comprehensive resource offering pre-computed biomarker prediction models (proteins) across diverse ancestries and protein-trait associations across several biobanks such as MVP and Finngene.

        <p>
        We develop theoretically sound and powerful methods for statistical inference in high-dimensional settings (p >> n). Key contributions include adaptive tests for high-dimensional parameters in GLMs, accommodating both low- and high-dimensional nuisance parameters (aiSPU; Wu et al., <a href="https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/sstest/j29n4/J29N429/J29N429.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Statistica Sinica</i> 2019</a>; <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/18-807.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>JMLR</i> 2020</a>), and novel testing procedures based on asymptotically independent U-statistics (He et al., <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-49/issue-1/Asymptotically-independent-U-statistics-in-high-dimensional-testing/10.1214/20-AOS1951.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Annals of Statistics</i> 2021</a>). These methods enhance statistical power and control Type 1 error rates in complex genomic and biomedical analyses, including applications to microbiome data (Wu et al., <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0302-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Genome Medicine</i> 2016</a>).
