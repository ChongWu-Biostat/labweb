Our research focuses on developing and applying novel statistical and computational methodologies to tackle complex challenges in genetics, genomics, and biomedical science. We leverage causal inference, machine learning, and integrative multi-omics analysis to gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and improve risk prediction.

        <p>
        We develop and apply methods for causal inference, with a strong focus on Mendelian Randomization (MR). Using genetic variants as instrumental variables allows us to probe causal relationships between exposures (like biomarkers or lifestyle factors) and disease outcomes from observational data, minimizing confounding. Our work includes developing robust MR techniques, addressing assumption violations (like horizontal pleiotropy), and applying these methods to understand disease etiology.

        <p>
        Our group pioneers statistical methods for analyzing high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. This includes integrating diverse data types like GWAS summary statistics, eQTL, DNA methylation, and proteomics to identify novel disease-associated genes and pathways. We focus on developing powerful and computationally efficient approaches for fine-mapping, pathway analysis, multi-omics data integration, and imputation (e.g., SUMMIT).

        We leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to push the boundaries of scientific discovery. Our research includes developing deep learning models for genomic prediction (e.g., DNA foundation models), using large language models to analyze clinical text for outcome prediction, exploring AI-driven drug discovery approaches, and creating robust ML algorithms for biomarker identification from complex biological data.

        <p>
        A significant part of our work involves developing accurate and robust models for predicting disease risk. We integrate clinical information with multi-omics data (genetics, epigenetics, proteomics) to build comprehensive prediction tools for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, aiming to contribute to personalized prevention and early detection strategies.

        Our methodological developments are driven by real-world biomedical questions. We collaborate closely with researchers and clinicians at MD Anderson and beyond to apply our statistical tools to understand the etiology of complex diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and various cancers (pancreatic, prostate). These collaborations ensure our methods are relevant and impactful.
