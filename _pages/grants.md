<strong><a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/fEzRBX-ZZk6Y7HE_Eo462A/project-details/10946247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering Causal Protein Markers to Characterize Pancreatic Cancer Etiology and Improve Risk Prediction</a></strong><br>
Funding Agency: NIH / National Cancer Institute (NCI)<br>
Grant Number: 1U01CA293883<br>
Role: MPI (Contact MPI: Lang Wu)<br>
Period: 09/18/2024 – 08/31/2029<br>
<em>Description: Addressing the limited understanding of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) etiology, this project aims to identify novel causal protein biomarkers by integrating large-scale proteomic data with genetic information using advanced methods like Proteome-Wide Association Studies (PWAS) and Mendelian Randomization (MR). Identified markers will undergo functional validation, and the findings will be used to develop improved, multi-ancestry risk prediction models for PDAC.</em> <!-- Expanded Description -->

<strong><a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Ryg4rDQF5UStEj2q4Vpusg/project-details/10446594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering causal protein markers to improve prostate cancer etiology understanding and risk prediction in Africans and Europeans</a></strong><br>
Funding Agency: NIH / National Cancer Institute (NCI)<br>
Grant Number: R01 CA263494<br>
Role: MPI (Contact PI: Lang Wu)<br>
Period: 07/01/2022 – 06/30/2027<br>
<em>Description: This study aims to improve the understanding of prostate cancer (PCa) etiology and risk prediction, particularly addressing disparities across Africans and Europeans. It involves: 1) identifying putative causal protein biomarkers using novel statistical methods and large-scale proteomic data; 2) functionally characterizing top biomarkers; and 3) developing and validating enhanced ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic prediction models incorporating these protein markers.</em> <!-- Expanded Description -->
