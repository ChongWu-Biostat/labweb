When teaching, my primary goals are to unveil the beauty of statistic and data science, promote students’ intellectual growth, and encourage students to develop into independent and lifelong learners.  Below is an overview of the courses I have instructed or organized, followed by my teaching philosophy.

## Teaching Philosophy (need to be updated. Tomorrow first thing)

My teaching philosophy centers on revealing the elegance and utility of statistics, fostering intellectual curiosity, and empowering students to become critical, independent learners prepared for both research and real-world application. I aim to achieve this through several key approaches:

**1. Making Statistics Accessible and Relevant:**
Many students approach statistics, especially introductory courses like STA 4321, with apprehension or view it solely as a requirement. My initial goal is to dismantle these barriers by demonstrating the inherent beauty and practical power of statistical thinking. I cultivate a positive and encouraging environment, clearly outlining learning objectives while incorporating relatable and impactful examples. For instance, when teaching set theory, we discuss its application in genomics using Venn diagrams. When covering conditional probability, we analyze the interpretation of sensitivity and specificity in the context of diagnostic tests (like those for COVID-19). Witnessing these direct connections often sparks genuine interest and motivates deeper engagement, showing students how statistics informs the world around them. Even if specific formulas fade over time, an appreciation for statistical reasoning can significantly influence their future endeavors.

**2. Fostering an Inclusive and Adaptive Learning Environment:**
Recognizing that students come from diverse academic backgrounds (from statistics to actuarial science and beyond) and possess varied learning styles, I employ differentiated instruction. Lectures are interspersed with active learning units, such as small group problem-solving sessions, allowing students to immediately apply concepts and engage collaboratively. During these activities (whether in person or in virtual breakout rooms), I circulate to provide individualized support and answer questions in a low-pressure setting. I emphasize the interconnectedness of statistical concepts, helping students build a coherent "big picture." Crucially, I solicit regular informal feedback on course pacing and content difficulty, allowing me to responsively adjust my teaching strategies to better meet the evolving needs of the class.

**3. Cultivating Independent and Creative Thinking for Research:**
In advanced courses like Statistical Genetics (STA 5934), the focus shifts towards preparing students for independent research. My goal is to equip them with the foundational knowledge and critical thinking skills needed to understand, evaluate, and contribute to cutting-edge research. I foster an open environment where active participation and thoughtful questions are encouraged (and rewarded). Students are guided to engage directly with primary literature, developing their ability to synthesize and critique complex studies. Assignments often involve summarizing and analyzing recent papers, using constructive feedback frameworks (like the 3-by-3 rule: identifying strengths and areas for improvement) to guide their scientific communication skills. A cornerstone of this course is a final project where students, often working collaboratively, propose and execute a small research investigation, culminating in a report and presentation. I am consistently impressed by their ability to integrate course material and independently explore advanced topics, demonstrating their growth into capable researchers.

Ultimately, I view teaching and mentorship as integral parts of my academic identity, constantly seeking new ways to enhance student learning and contribute to the development of future statisticians and collaborators. I strive to create a dynamic and supportive environment where students can build confidence, develop rigorous analytical skills, and appreciate the profound impact of statistics in science and society.
