<!-- Introduction and Call for Students -->
<p>
I'm very fortunate to work with many amazing students and researchers. Our group is <strong>actively seeking motivated PhD, Master's, and undergraduate students</strong> passionate about statistical genomics, causal inference, and AI in biomedicine to join our team. As faculty at MD Anderson, I am eligible to advise students enrolled through programs at the <strong>UTHealth Houston School of Public Health</strong> (including GSBS), <strong>Rice University</strong>, and <strong>MD Anderson UTHealth GSBS</strong>. Opportunities may also exist for students from <strong>Texas A&M University</strong>. We welcome talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. Feel free to contact me if you are interested to learn more about specific projects and opportunities!

    <!-- Short Bio -->
    <h5>Short Bio</h5>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and an affiliated faculty member of the Institute for Data Science in Oncology (IDSO) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Florida State University (Aug. 2018 - Aug. 2022). I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota (2013 - 2018), co-advised by Profs. <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/weihua-guan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weihua Guan</a> and <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/wei-pan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wei Pan</a>. My academic path began with a BS in Applied Mathematics (2013) from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Xiaoyang Zhou.
    </p>
    <p>
    My research program focuses on developing pioneering statistical methodologies and computational tools to analyze complex, large-scale biomedical data, particularly in genomics and genetics. My expertise spans statistical genetics (GWAS, TWAS, multi-omics integration, PRS), causal inference (Mendelian randomization, potential outcome frameworks), machine learning (clustering, prediction), and high-dimensional statistical inference. A major current focus is leveraging <strong>AI for scientific discovery</strong>, including developing foundational models for genetics, predicting cancer treatment outcomes using AI, exploring AI-driven drug discovery, and advancing AI applications in medicine more broadly. I am deeply committed to reproducible research, actively developing and maintaining open-source software (primarily R packages) to facilitate the adoption of our methods.
